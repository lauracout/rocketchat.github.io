GDPR, LGPD, CCPA, ... Ever heard of these acronyms?

Starting in 2018 in Europe with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), many other countries have passed laws to protect your privacy and your personal data. The LGPD in Brazil or the CCPA in California are among those laws and will come into force in 2020. Like with GDPR 2 years ago, organizations are faced with strict compliance obligations and are looking for tools to support them in their journey to compliance and to secure their user data.

The [International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP)](https://iapp.org/) is the largest and most comprehensive global information privacy community and resource, helping privacy practitioners and organizations manage and protect their data.It is a not-for-profit association founded in 2000 with a mission to define, support and improve the privacy profession globally.

Rocket.Chat is proud to be listed in the IAPP´s 2019 Privacy Tech Vendor Report. This annual report helps privacy professionals to select tools and partners to address the various compliance obligations from the laws mentioned above. Usually, organizations use a number of tools, like assessment managers or data mapping solutions. Rocket.Chat is listed in the category of "Enterprise Communications" - as we help organizations communicate internally in a secure way in order to avoid embarrassing or dangerous leaks of communications.

## Rocket.Chat as "Privacy Tech"

Rocket.Chat is the ideal platform for privacy-conscious organizations as our platform comes with numerous features, such as:
- [Open Source Code](https://github.com/RocketChat)
- Possibility for private hosting, even air gapped (without connecting to the internet, in your private network)
- End-to-End Encryption
- User data export mechanisms
- Granular permission system
- Secure authentication standards

Especially with our source code being public and having thousands of contributors and reviewers, you can rest assured that no one else is getting access to your data through hidden backdoors. You can run Rocket.Chat on your own infrastructure - even on a [Raspberry Pi!](https://rocket.chat/2018/02/01/11-ways-to-install-rocket-chat/) - and no one except you owns the data in it. We don't make money with your data - because we never get access to it. You don't get this technical assurance of control if you use tools like Slack or MS Teams as you always have to trust the provider of these services.

You can find us on page 136 of the IAPP report. Get your free copy of the report [here](https://iapp.org/resources/article/2019-privacy-tech-vendor-report/).

## What is coming next?
