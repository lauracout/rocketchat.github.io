### RocketChatViewController

The huge dependency that we were using in our app until the last versions has now been deprecated.
We were keen to take our time to carry out some research, experiment and carefully rewrite the entire thing. All message components (text, separators, attachments, etc.) have thus been rewritten in a much more modern and reusable way. To do so, we have created an entirely separate library called RocketChatViewController. This library can be reused in other chat applications.

### Dynamic Type support on the messages list

We take accessibility very seriously in our app, and not supporting Dynamic Type on the messages list was a significant shortcoming for our application in this respect.
From this version onwards, the list will adapt to the configuration on your device in order to present the most appropriate font size for you.

### New Message Components

We have redesigned most of the components with this version’s rewrite and are now using a bigger font by default, boxes for text attachments and replies, borders on images, and a new component for audio and video messages.

### New Composer
